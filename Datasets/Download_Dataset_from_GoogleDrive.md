### Download datasets

-------------
1) Download the datasets (include structure information in "PDBbind_struct" and compound graph, 
protein sequence and affinity information in "Traindata") generated from general set of PDBbind-v2020 with the measurement of "IC50" and "KIKD" from the URL link of 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GnnwBOFlewZBfSodpfz3hb04D9oTKsT5?usp=sharing. 

2) And then, please unzip the file under the folder of "Datasets" in this project before training. 
(Please make sure the paths of "FeatNN/Datasets/PDBbind_Struct/", and "FeatNN/Datasets/Traindata/" are exist in this project.)

3) 

The script of "train_FeatNN.py" will successfully execute with after the deployment of these steps.
